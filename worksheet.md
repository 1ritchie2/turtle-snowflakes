# Draw a Snowflake with Code

Let's create a beautiful landscape of snowflakes using python turtle. Along the way you will learn how to think in seuqneces, use loops to repeat a sequence, use the random module, and how to use functions.

To begin you will need to open the Python 3 programming environment **IDLE3**. You can do this by selecting it from the **Main Menu** with your mouse. Then click on **File** and **New Window** to open a blank text editor window to write your code into. Save your empty file by clicking on **File**, **Save As** and naming it `snowflake.py`.

## Step 1: How to draw with python turtle

1. To begin using turtle in python you need to import the turtle library. At the top of the text editor window type `import turtle`

1. Next a command is needed to create the window which will display your turtle drawings `turtle.Screen()`. To save having to type it out every time you need the command you can store it as a **variable**:

  ```python
  wn = turtle.Screen()
  ```
  *Note: There is a capital letter used here for Screen. It is important to get uppercase and lowercase syntax correct in python in order for your code to work.*
  
1. Time to give your turtle a name, you can use a variable to do this. I'm naming my turtle Elsa but you can name yours whatever you like.

  ```python
  elsa = turtle.Turtle()
  ```
