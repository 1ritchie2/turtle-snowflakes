# Draw a Snowflake with Code

Let's create a beautiful landscape of snowflakes using python turtle. Along the way you will learn how to think in seuqneces, use loops to repeat a sequence, use the random module, and how to use functions.

To begin you will need to open the Python 3 programming environment **IDLE3**. You can do this by selecting it from the **Main Menu** with your mouse. Then click on **File** and **New Window** to open a blank text editor window to write your code into. Save your empty file by clicking on **File**, **Save As** and naming it `snowflake.py`.

## Step 1: How to draw with python turtle

To begin using turtle in python you need to import the turtle library. At the top of the text editor window type `import turtle` 


## Step 2: How to turn with python turtle


## Step 3: Using loops to create shapes


## Step 4: Creating spiral patterns


## Step 5: Changing the pen colour randomly


## Step 6: Using a function to draw a snowflake


## Step 7: Creating a window of snowflakes
